export("matchCluster\n\nProvide an alternative matching method for target and ref clusters.\nMTJ 28FEB2022\nRequires flexclust, pracma libraries\nCalculate all pairwise distances between all target cluster peaks and reference cluster peaks and filter for tolerance. Match each peak with its closest ref peak:\n  A)\n    start with lowest overall distance, assign target[i] to ref[r] peak, record ref[r] as unavailable (remove its matches in the distance matrix)\n    find next lowest distance match, and repeat until no more matches\n    – easier to implement right now, necessary update if staying with GG code\n  B) \n    find the best set of matches which satisfy the following:\n    ppm ranks are preserved (no criss-crossing of match lines)\n    ref peaks can be assigned to at most one target peak\n    best match set determined by sum of distances\n    –> alternative, potentially better qualities and potentially faster (no loop/complex decision tree)\n    install.packages(here(RcppHungarian), repos=NULL, type=\"source\")")
