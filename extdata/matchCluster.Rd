 Requires flexclust, pracma libraries
 Calculate all pairwise distances between all target cluster peaks and reference cluster peaks and filter for tolerance. Match each peak with its closest ref peak:
 A)
 start with lowest overall distance, assign target[i] to ref[r] peak, record ref[r] as unavailable (remove its matches in the distance matrix)
 find next lowest distance match, and repeat until no more matches
 - easier to implement right now, necessary update if staying with GG code
 B)
 find the best set of matches which satisfy the following:
 ppm ranks are preserved (no criss-crossing of match lines)
 ref peaks can be assigned to at most one target peak
 best match set determined by sum of distances
 -> alternative, potentially better qualities and potentially faster (no loop/complex decision tree)
