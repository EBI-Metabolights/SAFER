\alias{runs2ranges}
\title{Since positions (e.g. "keep" in compress_stack()) are just runs of increasing inds,
there isn't really a need to keep all of them. Rather, just store the start and end
points of the runs.}
\usage{
runs2ranges(keep)
}
\arguments{
\item{keep}{vector of non-sparse position inds}
}
\value{
ranges of the incremental runs in keep (can be directly expanded to whatever was in keep)
}
\description{
Example: all.equal(expand_runs(runs2ranges(keep)), keep)
}
