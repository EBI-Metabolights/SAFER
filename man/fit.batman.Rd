\title{Fit a two-component model to a feature and a reference spectrum}
\usage{
fit.batman(feat, spec, exclude.lowest = 0.5, ppm = NULL, plots = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{feat}{a numeric vector of the feature spectrum}

\item{spec}{a numeric vector of the reference spectrum}

\item{exclude.lowest}{the fraction of the lowest values to exclude from the ratio calculation (default is 0.5)}

\item{ppm}{a numeric vector of the parts per million (ppm) values for the spectra (default is NULL)}

\item{plots}{logical, whether to generate plots (default is FALSE)}
}
\value{
a list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{feat.fit}: a numeric vector of the fitted feature spectrum
\item \code{spec.fit}: a numeric vector of the fitted reference spectrum
\item \code{keypoint}: the index of the keypoint where the ratio of the two spectra is minimum
\item \code{ratio}: the ratio of the feature and reference spectra at the keypoint
\item \code{intercept}: the intercept of the reference spectrum
\item \code{residuals}: a numeric vector of the residuals between the fitted feature and reference spectra
\item \code{plot}: a plot of the fitted feature and reference spectra (if plots = TRUE)
}
