\title{Select rows from compressed matrix (c.stack)
selection contains the necessary information to reconstruct selected rows,
but nothing else. Returns c.stack object. NOTE: positions are still with 
regard to the FULL stack; however, decompressing with cstack_expandRows will
only return the selection (row order preserved).}
\usage{
cstack_selectRows(c.stack, row.nums)
}
\arguments{
\item{c.stack}{compressed matrix object}
}
\value{
compressed matrix with only the selected row data
         - pos : linear index within FULL stack
         - vals: non-NA vals from FULL stack 
         - m : number of rows in stack
         - n : number of columns in stack
Example selection <-  cstack_selectRows(c.stack, row.nums = c(1,2))
}
