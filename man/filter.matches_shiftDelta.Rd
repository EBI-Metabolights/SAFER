\title{Filter matches based on ppm shift difference}
\usage{
\method{filter}{matches_shiftDelta}(match.info, feature, ppm, fits.feature, ppm.tol = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{match.info}{A data frame containing the match information}

\item{feature}{A feature object with position information}

\item{ppm}{A numeric vector of ppm values}

\item{fits.feature}{A logical vector indicating whether each match fits the feature}

\item{ppm.tol}{The maximum allowed ppm shift difference between the feature and the match}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: the filtered `match.info` data frame, and the filtered `fits.feature` logical vector
}
\description{
This function filters the matches in match.info based on the difference in 
ppm shift between the feature and the match. Only matches with a ppm shift 
difference less than or equal to ppm.tol are retained.
}
